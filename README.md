# weatherMonitor
Quick test task, I've made in java.
The task was: develop system for receiving and storage weather data from 2 sources. 
Data for store: temperature, wind speed, wind direction, pressure and humidity.
I've used:
	-Maven
	-Gson for working with JSON. Java classes was generated from JSON by http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/
	-SQLite as database, I've just wanted to try it.
